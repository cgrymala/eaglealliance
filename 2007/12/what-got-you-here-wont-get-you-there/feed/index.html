					<description><![CDATA[This sounds very interesting and very helpfultips for leaders.  it brings to mind a situation that I&#039;m facing about an employee I dislike because of his being sneaky about a situation I said wasn&#039;t permissible and then manipulating the situation to do it anyway.  I would think he should be terminated for violating the rules and I thought the director was going to issue a warning but hasn&#039;t and now the person is taking a new job come the end of August.  He isn&#039;t aware that I know about what he did and this eats at me because it is unfair.  so maybe I need to learn how to &quot;let go&quot;  any other advice you have would be great!  I know others struggle with this also.  Mary Ann]]></description>
