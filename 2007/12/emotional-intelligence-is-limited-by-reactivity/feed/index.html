					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your comment, Leslie,

I agree with your suggestions too.  The physical acts of smiling or walking do wonders.  

I keep working on improving my ability &quot;to be in the shoes of the person.&quot;  My category on the right, Relationship Mgt. has some more Tips on empathy.

					<description><![CDATA[Another technique is to change the subject while practicing the techniques you suggest. Something mindless works well because, while discussing that other subject, what one is really doing is things like those you suggest. I also practice asking myself what it&#039;s like to be in the shoes of the person who made the remark and hence try to discover what led him or her to make it. This is not specific to your topic, every morning I try to remind myself that I am a good, giving, and very competent person. And, oh, yes, the physical act of smiling seems to create endorphins. If the subject is a big one, also to produce endorphins, I might suggest going for a walk while we discuss the matter (but not here in FL in the summer...way too hot and humid).]]></description>
