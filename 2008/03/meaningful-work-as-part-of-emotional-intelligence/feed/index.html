					<description><![CDATA[I agree that in finding one&#039;s own values, individuals are more productive and willing to learn as they ultimately choose careers that support those values.  Unfortunately, many corporations don&#039;t care about work/life balance and personal development and would rather focus on performance and results before investing in employees&#039; well-being.  My passion as both a social worker and business professional is to bridge that gap.  With that being said, hats off to those that are involved in doing the same!
