					<description><![CDATA[Linda,
I am glad that you liked my book chapter on &quot;Emotional Intelligence for Resilience.&quot;  You wrote in your comment, &quot;knowing what we want at the deepest level is what I need to do to keep my passion and commitment for the project.&quot;  

Yes, as your project continues, you tend to tire out under the stress.  In this case, resilience is about recovering your passion. Keep it up.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Bill,

I read your chapter in Upping the Downside and appreciated your insights. We are developing some software to take our product online and it&#039;s exciting and stressful all at the same time. I realized that knowing what we want at the deepest level is what I need to do to keep my passion and commitment for the project.

Thank you again for putting into words what I needed to understand.

					<description><![CDATA[Todd,
You comment is about brain research which I have read a little about.  Yes, we can only remind ourself of goals once we have regained focus, not an easy job.

I can only speculate that resilience would correlate positively with your interests in creativity.  I am emphasizing clarity of intention as a big part of resilience.  That clarity keeps one centered as does meditation as you said.  Once centered, I think some forms of creativity can emerge.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Bill,
It sounds like the clarity you mention is a clarity of understanding and will.  Let me know if I&#039;m rephrasing you in a reductionist way.  We know that many emotional responses, including traumatic reactions, happen faster in the brain than reminding oneself of goals or understanding can happen (in a particular moment).
I don&#039;t want to sidetrack your focus from business, but I&#039;m wondering--with that sort of neurological/emotional research in mind: how do you relate your ideas about resilience to creativity, inspiration, and spontaneity?  I&#039;ve studied a lot of meditative techniques, and I&#039;m wondering how far professionals like yourself have gone with some of your interests and research.
