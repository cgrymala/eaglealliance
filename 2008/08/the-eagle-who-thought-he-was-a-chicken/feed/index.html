					<description><![CDATA[Bill, I really like your explanation of your company name. I don&#039;t get the time to read all of your emails, so perhaps you&#039;ve explained before and I&#039;ve missed it. If so, I apologize.

On the subject of your essay, one small comment: I think that we are afraid, not only of being grand, but simultaneously of being small. In fact, we are usually both grand and inadequate, I think. And living with this paradox is the supreme challenge because we must every day, over and over, navigate between these two opposing poles.

Warmly,
Leslie]]></description>
