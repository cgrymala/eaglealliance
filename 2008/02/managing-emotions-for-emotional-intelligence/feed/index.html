I was just in a place trying to figure out how to manage my emotions so that I can move forward on my goals I set for the day. The tips have really helped me move to a place of productive action. Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bill,
Great tip, to first be self-aware. I have also found another set of cognitive self-help tools through Recovery International to be very helpful (go to www.recovery-inc.org). I find that if I can drop the judgment of someone being wrong (someone else or myself), then my anger goes down. I learn to express my feelings and suppress my temper, as your example with the late reports described.
Thanks again for the tip,
Tracy]]></description>
