					<description><![CDATA[Comment from Dr. Leslie Levy: Your comment is awaiting moderation.
Sometimes engaging the other person in conversation may not be the best solution. Here is a personal and painful example.
After years of enduring a passive-aggressive “friend” and colleague whom I did not recognize was bullying me. I finally came to my senses…but could not have done it without observations and advice from friends, most of whom had seen us interact. This woman was, I thought, a close friend. Meanwhile, she consistently painted her situation as pitiful, and her situation has come to be exactly that. However, had she followed my advice (and that of others who were drawn into her web), she would not be suffering the problems she is now experiencing. She made work commitments to me that she did not fulfill. I gave her much more money and goods than her work merited. …All this because she is very smart and can perform incredibly well under the “right” circumstances and because I felt sorry for her.
I’ve thought a lot about my own motives. Although there have been times in the past when I hired people who were needy under terms that led me to think i was getting a bargain, these arrangements never worked out; I came to realize that the cost to me was unacceptably high. Either these people did not deliver or else I experienced so much angst in working with them that the price was too high. I stopped hiring people like that years ago.
I think this case is different, but perhaps I’m wrong. In any case, I came to my senses initially when a friend observed that people who are constantly after more of my money are almost never worth it and that this woman appeared to be destroying my serenity. How true! Subsequently, I told others who had seen me interact with this woman, and suddenly their observations of her manipulation of me poured forth. I don’t know why they didn’t mention that before and will try to find out.
Meanwhile, I no longer have to work or otherwise interact with this bully, who has proved herself no friend of mine. I hope that I’ll recognize earlier and better in the future when someone is bullying me. I think that may be particularly difficult when the person poses as a friend and uses passive-aggressive and withholding behavior.
I would welcome any feedback on what I’ve written here. I think that the most important lesson is to avoid people who destroy one’s feelings of well-being or serenity.

					<description><![CDATA[My comment was that bullying is learned, and enforced by culture that is dictated at the top--bullies exist when top managers are bullies or tolerate them.

					<description><![CDATA[The issue is more complicated when working in a company culture that is aggressive and where the line between bullying and &quot;strict father mentality&quot; is blurred, and where communication is expected to only flow from top down, just as it does in dictatorial government systems.  Bullying by managers is the second lowest motivational strategy (above only not doing anything), but I believe it is a learned strategy, observed by those they report to--the biggest bullies usually have a bully above them, so I do not see a way to fix that unless you start fixing the company culture from the top.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Leslie,
Thanks again for another good addition to a blog post.  I was such a person in a hospital and heard a lot about bullying.  I often took action too.

					<description><![CDATA[Many companies now have whistleblowers or else a person to whom abuse can be confidentially reported. Generally that person undertakes a quiet, secret investigation, though some situations cannot be investigated secretly. Normally this individual reports to the CEO or the board of directors. In general, experience with whistleblowers has reportedly been positive and could certainly be used to report bullying. If enough employees complain about the same individual&#039;s behavior, action becomes virtually inevitable.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good tips.  That type of training should be mandatory for both managers and employees.  There&#039;s an explosive new ebook called Work Laws Exposed that will cause some heads to roll in the workplace when the training vaccination doesn&#039;t stick.  It was written by an employment law attorney. You can find it here:  http://www.stressfulworkplacehelp.com/articles/bullies-in-the-workplace.htm]]></description>
