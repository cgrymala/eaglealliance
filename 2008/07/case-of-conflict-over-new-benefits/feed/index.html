					<description><![CDATA[We are in this situation now with our current plan with a 0 deductible going up 62% this year.  Our board has been very aggressive in a new plan of a $3500/$7000 deductible.  quite a shock for people!  However they are funding most of the deductible.  I was surprised that Ih aven&#039;t heard more complaints, but Ithink our insurance representatives did a fine job of presenting the new plan and gave sufficient time for questions.  the board is still looking at how to make loans available for the high cost of prescriptions.

Hopefully, we are in this win win situation!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[thnx for the story on restoring balance and peaceful relationships after a conflict. 

for more information about solving problems in communities follow Dominic Barter on Twitter @RestoraCircles

Dominic Barter works in the Brazilian fevelas, schools, communities and prisons to restore peace in communities that have unimaginable difficulties. The process he is developing works mainly because of three components 1) moving toward conflict and 2)both communities and individuals being responsible for creating what they need 3) empathetic listening and speaking. 

It will work in whatever community setting (business or personal) I have been involved with.]]></description>
