					<description><![CDATA[Jo,
Thanks for your comment. 
I agree that an organizational culture needs to be created to support good disciplinary action.  I tried to do that while I was in charge of this.  Often I influenced managers to change their approach.

					<description><![CDATA[I think the self-fulfilling prophecy is one of the most important concepts in psychology. Dov Eden has done amazing research showing its power even to reduce incidents of sea sickness.  I found university students listen with the saddened ideas of relief to lectures on its impact.  One can only imagine what they have had to put up with.   Then, as we link it to self-efficacy, their eyes brighten.  They &quot;got&quot; the idea that collectively they had the power to make or break the careers of professors, particularly youngsters, and determine the atmosphere in the university.  I was impressed that it never took more than 2x50 minute slots.

What alarmed me though was that your management procedures don&#039;t require you to take action against those managers.  Of course take action against would set off a spiral too.  This kind of management does a lot of damage to company and employees alike and I would have thought that a worthwhile goal would be change the culture.

PS I have worked in cultures where managers may not manage on whim and cultures where management is by whim.  Happy to  back channel with anyone struggling with this.]]></description>
